 * Testcase Example:  '3'
 *
 * Given an integer rowIndex, return the rowIndex^th (0-indexed) row of the
 * Pascal's triangle.
 * 
 * In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly
 * above it as shown:
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: rowIndex = 3
 * Output: [1,3,3,1]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: rowIndex = 0
 * Output: [1]
 * Example 3:
 * Input: rowIndex = 1
 * Output: [1,1]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= rowIndex <= 33
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(rowIndex) extra
 * space?
